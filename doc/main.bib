abstract="Uncertainty models such as sets of desirable gambles and (conditional) lower previsions can be represented as convex cones. Checking the consistency of and drawing inferences from such models requires solving feasibility and optimization problems. We consider finitely generated such models. For closed cones, we can use linear programming; for conditional lower prevision-based cones, there is an efficient algorithm using an iteration of linear programs. We present an efficient algorithm for general cones that also uses an iteration of linear programs.",

abstract="We present a variant of the CONEstrip algorithm for checking whether the origin lies in a finitely generated convex cone that can be open, closed, or neither. This variant is designed to deal efficiently with problems where the rays defining the cone are specified as linear combinations of propositional sentences. The variant differs from the original algorithm in that we apply row generation techniques. The generator problem is WPMaxSAT, an optimization variant of SAT; both can be solved with specialized solvers or integer linear programming techniques. We additionally show how optimization problems over the cone can be solved by using our propositional CONEstrip algorithm as a preprocessor. The algorithm is designed to support consistency and inference computations within the theory of sets of desirable gambles. We also make a link to similar computations in probabilistic logic, conditional probability assessments, and imprecise probability theory.",

  abstract = 	 {The desirable gambles framework offers the most comprehensive foundations for the theory of lower previsions, which in turn affords the most general account of imprecise probabilities. Nevertheless, for all its generality, the theory of lower previsions rests on the notion of linear utility. This commitment to linearity is clearest in the coherence axioms for sets of desirable gambles. This paper considers two routes to relaxing this commitment. The first preserves the additive structure of the desirable gambles framework and the machinery for coherent inference but detaches the interpretation of desirability from the multiplicative scale invariance axiom. The second strays from the additive combination axiom to accommodate repeated gambles that return rewards by a non-stationary processes that is not necessarily additive. Unlike the first approach, which is a conservative amendment to the desirable gambles framework, the second is a radical departure. Yet, common to both is a method for describing rewards called <em>discounted utility</em>.}
